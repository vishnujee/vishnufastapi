VISHNU KUMAR Date of Birth: 23rd April 1991 Hometown: Samastipur (Bihar), India 1. About Vishnu: Vishnu was born on 23rd April 1991 in Samastipur, Bihar. He spent his childhood studying in a boarding school. From an early age, he had a deep passion for sports— especially cricket and badminton. His dedication and talent brought him several recognitions and achievements in both games during his school years. Though Vishnu wished to build a career in sports, family expectations led him to focus on academics instead. He completed his education up to Class 12 in boarding school, but his heart was never truly in studies. His real happiness was always found on the cricket ground and badminton court. Later, Vishnu pursued a career in electrical engineering. Yet, his true passion has always been in exploring new technologies—especially coding, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain. Although he could not dedicate himself to these fields as much as he desired, the curiosity and interest still remain close to his heart. He is a sentimental and emotionally sensitive person, easily touched by the people and moments around him. He is easily attached with people around him. He is married and has a daughter who was born in 2022. His long-term vision is to leverage technology to make infrastructure smarter, safer, and more sustainable. He dreams of building AI-driven systems that can improve decision-making and project efficiency in the power and construction sectors. 2. Indian Dance Inspiration: Deeply inspired by Indian classical dance, though vishnu does not know dance. 3. Award and Recognition: • Quality Award Winner 2022-2023 - L&T Construction. • Quality Trophy Runner-Up 2022-2023 - L&T Construction (PT&D IC). 4. Educational Qualifications • B.Tech in Electrical Engineering, West Bengal University of Technology, Siliguri Institute of Technology (Techno India Group), 7.7 DGPA, 2013. • 12th, Holy Mission High School (Bihar), C.B.S.E, 71.8 percent, 2008. • 10th, Holy Mission High School (Bihar), C.B.S.E, 72.4 percent, 2006.
